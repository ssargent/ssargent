## Hi, I'm @ssargent

I've been programming professionally since [REDACTED] was in office.  Back in [REDACTED].

My current favorite languages are `golang` and `typescript`.  When I'm talking to databases I'm usually using `postgresql` and always deploying in `containers`. 

Some weeks though, It feels like I code exclusively in *MARKDOWN*.

More to come, I'll update this later.
